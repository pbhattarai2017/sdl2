# SDL2 Examples

This repository contains example projects of SDL2. Each example is a single file c program which can be invoked after the following preparations.

### Setup custom 'maker'
> $ `gcc` -o maker maker.c

> $ `alias` maker=./maker

### Execute the project
Initially, run `make prep` to setup project structure

Then, use `maker` alias to make file, for example; main.c
> $ maker main

To execute the file
> $ maker

***
Note: We need to make each file individually.
